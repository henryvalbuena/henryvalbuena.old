      <h2>Welcome</h2>
      <p>
        My name is <a class="link" href="#">Henry</a> and I am driven by simple curiosity, since my adolescence I have been into computers, how they work and what makes them do what they do. 
        Afterwards, I went to the university in search for more and be the cool tech guy that knows about circuits and robots... seriously, I'm still thinking that being and Electronic Engineer is pretty cool.
        But there, is when in my first course of programming I fell in love with one of my favorite hobbies, coding. 
        Since then, I have been working as a professional in my engineering career and in my free time building programs, learning how to use Java, C/C++ and others programming languages just for the excitement of creating cool things. 
        To me, it was unreal to just understand how to create something that worked in my computer and did something incredible as well. In time my passion was only growing, 
        it was then in 2017 when I decided to make a career change to build software and pursue my passion as a professional.

      <h3 class="sub-title">Skills</h3>          
      <p>
        The majority of the technical skills I have learned so far were self-taught throughout the years, doing online courses or reading, and now enhanced with the current programming diploma I am taking. 
        The networking skills were part of my engineering degree and also by taking CCNA and CCNP certifications at that moment.

        <h3 class="sub-title">Future Plans and Ambitions</h2>
        <p>
          Right now, I'm working on expanding my understanding of socket programming through my most recent project (check next section).
          However, I'm very excited to move on to my next project, which will serve as the basis to learn Python and Machine Learning, this
          will allow me to take the leap into AI path which I'm very excited about.
        </p>
        <p>
          And finally, my idea is to build and integrate could computing applications and the use of deep learning
          to evaluate trends in the stock market and make predictions in the process, with this I will consolidate
          the new skill sets I want to learn very soon and invest some <i class="money bill alternate outline icon"></i>. For me this is a very ambitious and challenging 
          personal goal that at the same time makes it more interesting.

          <h3 class="sub-title">Data Communication Client-Server API</h3>
          <p>
            Designed and developed a client-server application which communicates to a remote server
            using sockets and TCP protocol. The idea behind it is to experiment with socket programming and how
            two terminals can exchange data effectively. The client application was built with a combination of C and C++.
            C is used to access the platform libraries that contains all the necessary methods to establish data communication using TCP and sockets. 
            C++ is used for the rest of the modules that compose the client application, there is a wrapper which has methods to create the socket file descriptor, connect, send, 
            receive data and close the connection. Additionally, a special module which is used to transform strings into JSON format since the data transfer between the terminals 
            is standardized by the using JSON to exchange data effectively across platforms. The server-side program is done using node.js and built in methods to create sockets to listen for incoming connections, receive and send data.
          </p>
          <p>
          Testing the client app, assuming there is a service in the server that has
          an id = 20, will return a response.

          <h3 class="sub-title">Web Browser Game</h3>
          <p>
            Designed and developed a small 2D web browser game which uses GPL assets for the graphics and sound effects from various artists, making use of plain JavaScript and modular programming. 
            In there, the basics of the game is like a spaceship shooter and an infinite loop of enemy alien ships placed in random spots that fire back. 
            The logic behind it, incorporates algorithms for collision detection to create the animations: explosion of the enemy ships when hit by lasers, player life update if hit or struck by enemy ships and so on. 
            There are some special features like, upgraded weapons and a shield which makes the playerâ€™s spaceship immune for a period of time. 
            Everything is done by the use of JavaScript and DOM manipulation. The visuals are generated by the use of the canvas objects and a version of OOP manipulating these objects.

            <h3 class="sub-title">Maze Solving Application</h3>
            <p>
              Developed an application which takes an image of squared shaped size L * L with black and white colors that represent
              the walls (black) and the path (white) for the maze. The program checks the maze and using three / graph algorithms like Deep First Search
              find the way out from the starting position. Making use of Java and the standard libraries the image is read from the file system, read
              pixel by pixel to determine the walls and the path and then using Lists and graph algorithms construct the available path
              to return a copy of the image with the solution marked down in color.
